1. Add `homepage` to `package.json`
`"homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",`

2. Install `gh-pages` in the terminal
`npm install --save gh-pages`

3. Deploy to `scripts` in `package.json` by adding `predeploy` and `deploy` as below
`"scripts": { "predeploy": "npm run build", "deploy": "gh-pages -d build" }`

4. Deploy the site by running `npm run deploy` in the terminal

5. Make sure GitHub Pages option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the `gh-pages` branch

## Credits

This was coded along the project walkthrough by Andrei Neagoie on [ZTM](https://zerotomastery.io/) in the React.js Fundamentals section of the Complete Web Developer in 2024: Zero to Mastery course.

The robot images were randomly selected via API from [robohash](https://robohash.org/).

## Reflective Learning

This was my first foray into React. I learned the following concepts:

- **Components:** building blocks of a React app, which are small, reusable parts that can be assembled to create UIs.
- **Containers:** smart components that manage state or interact with logic (like fetching data from an API).
- **One way data flow:** data moves from the top to the bottom of the component hierarchy.
    - **State:** represents the dynamic data in a component, like user input or fetched data.
    - **Props:** a way of passing data from a parent component down to a child component. A parent component (like a container) can pass its state or other data to child components via props, but the child component canâ€™t modify the prop.
